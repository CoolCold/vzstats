.SH NAME
vzstats \- report OpenVZ usage statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vzstats
.br
.BR vzstats\ --view | --status
.br
.BR vzstats\ --enable | --disable
.br
.BR vzstats\ --help
.SH DESCRIPTION
Utility \fBvzstats\fR, installed on an OpenVZ server, periodically collects
some usage statistics and sends it to the OpenVZ stats server,
.BR http://stats.openvz.org ,
for processing and analysis. Aggregated statistics from all reports are
available through the web interface.
.P
Statistics reported include some basic hardware information (CPU, RAM,
file system and disk space usage for \fB/vz\fR), software
information (distribution version, kernel version, OpenVZ software versions),
and some OpenVZ-specific information (number of containers running/total,
number of containers using \fBvswap\fR and \fBploop\fR, used OS templates
etc.). Information submission is anonymous; information that can be used to
directly identify a particular host (i.e. MAC or IP addresses, hostnames
etc.) is not being reported.
.P
For the server to anonymously identify reports from the same client,
a unique random ID (UUID v4) is requested from the server during the
first \fBvzstats\fR run. It is then saved locally and used when sending
reports.
.P
If run without any options and unless disabled, \fBvzstats\fR runs report
scripts found in \fBREPDIR\fR (defined in \fBvzstats.conf\fR, default is
\fB@REPDIR@\fR), collects their output and sends it, as a tarball,
to stats server.
.SH OPTIONS
In case any option is provided, no report is being send, instead an action
denoted by the option is performed.
.P
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B --view
Collect but do not send report, giving a user an ability to see what
exact information would be send.
.TP
.B --config
Output current \fBvzstats\fR configuration, including:
.br
\(bu current version number;
.br
\(bu status (enabled or disabled);
.br
\(bu an URL used to submit reports to;
.br
\(bu vzstats UUID;
.br
\(bu report scripts directory.
.TP
.B --disable
Disable reporting. This is performed by creating a marker file,
.BR @ETCDIR@/vzstats-disable .
\fBvzstats\fR checks this file upon start, and exits if it is present.
.TP
.B --enable
Re-enable reporting.
.TP
.B --help
Show usage.
